                    I started my career as a web developer at MNLeistung Inc., where I was responsible for developing and maintaining the company&apos;s and clients' websites.
                    As a fresh graduate, I was familiar with basic technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, and cPanel hosting on free providers.
                    Within a few weeks, I began learning Laravel so I could assist with the hospital system development when I didn&apos;t have tasks related to the websites I handled.

                <p className="text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-200 text-sm md:text-lg font-normal mb-8">
                    A few months into my role, while maintaining our company website, I proposed migrating the site to Laravel.
                    This migration would allow me to deepen my understanding of Laravel&apos;s folder structure, clean up the existing spaghetti code,
                    and implement a proper folder structure and code splitting to make the codebase more readable and maintainable. Additionally,
                    an upcoming website refresh aligned perfectly with my suggestions, making it the ideal time to implement these improvements.

                    Thanks to my friendly nature, I built a strong connection with the mobile team.
                    Their team lead eventually invited me to join and assist with their front-end tasks.
                    This was when I was introduced to React.js. In just two weeks, I learned the basics of React Router,
                    Ionic Framework with Capacitor, and how styling works in React.

                    A few months later, I was tasked with redesigning the company website to make it unique and appealing to potential developer applicants.
                    As the sole developer on the project, I collaborated closely with a Graphic Designer to bring the vision to life. To achieve a modern and
                    efficient development process, I chose to use React.js with Vite.

                    With the release of Next.js 13.4, I was excited to explore its new features, such as the App Router, Image component,
                    and built-in support for SSG, SSR, and SEO enhancements. Since my ongoing project was built with React,
                    I saw the opportunity to migrate it to Next.js. However, we lacked a Node server, limiting the full potential of Next.js.
                    I found a workaround by building the project statically using the next export command and successfully deploying it on shared hosting.

                    During this project, I learned a lot, including using Tailwind CSS, which was easy to pick up due to my solid understanding of vanilla CSS.
                    I also tackled browser compatibility issues for transparent animated videos, learned Framer Motion for animations, and honed my front-end skills,
                    such as responsive design techniques and design best practices like contrast and spacing.

                    as my boss noted that in Germany, websites could be built within a few hours, setting a high standard of at least one day for completion.</p>

                    other drag-and-drop builders. However, after evaluating the options, the decision was made to focus on the Philippine market instead.</p>

                    Despite these hurdles, I remained committed to meeting the deadline. I continued working even after working hours,
                    driven by my passion for web development. While my colleagues were playing games at night,
                    I focused on completing the designs provided by the Graphic Designer.
                    The hard work was challenging but fulfilling, as it felt like pursuing a hobby I truly enjoy.</p>

                    During the project, we faced an additional challenge when one of the four websites needed to be redone due to the clientâ€™s
                    dissatisfaction with the previously approved design. Amidst this, a significant new project emerged: a government housing initiative.
                    I was assigned to this project because three of the websites I managed needed to integrate an application form submission for beneficiaries.

                    I collaborated closely with the C# team to develop the necessary API for this integration, ensuring seamless functionality between the application
                    form and the websites I handled. This added responsibility was demanding but allowed me to contribute to a high-impact project while managing multiple tasks.</p>

                    After completing all my pending projects, my final task was to integrate all sales and marketing suggestions into the websites.
                    This included implementing Google Ads, conversion tracking, creating booking systems, setting up call-to-action (CTA) elements,
                    and ensuring form submissions were directed to the company's CRM via API. I also created dedicated pages for each of the company's systems,
                    optimized them for SEO, and made them searchable on Google. Lastly, I compiled comprehensive documentation for all the websites I managed,
                    detailing the work completed and the integrations applied.</p>
